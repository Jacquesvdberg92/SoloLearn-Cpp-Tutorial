Variables

Specifying the data type is required just once, at the time when the variable is declared.
After that, the variable may be used without referring to the data type. int a;
a = 10;
Specifying the data type for a given variable more than once results in a syntax error.

A variable's value may be changed as many times as necessary throughout the program.

For example:
int a = 100;
a = 50;
cout << a;

// Outputs 50
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
